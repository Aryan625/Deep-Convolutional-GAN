# Deep-Convolutional-GAN

In this project, I have built a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) that generates gray scale images of Fashion MNIST. This model is trained on a Fashion MNIST dataset.
In order to build this Model, I took the following steps:
  -	Imported the packages and defined a utility function that will be used in the project.
  -	Download and Prepare the Dataset
  -	Build the Model:
    -	Two sub network is used that is Generator and Discriminator
  -	Configured the Model for training 
  -	Trained the model for 100 epochs

The images that were generated by the model after 100 epochs can be seen below:
